    "The next step was to get a sense of the types of crimes contained in these data. By looking at the \"Primary Type\" column I could see a standardized description of the type of crime each observation in the data represents. The data contain a wide array of offenses. To build a model that could predict every type of crime would require a large number of different features. Thus, I felt it was appropriate to limit this exercise to just looking at one type of crime. I chose Burglary since it is a common offense in Chicago, and I felt I could develop an appropriate set of model features for predicting this type of crime."
